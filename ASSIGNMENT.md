# Take-Home Project: Computer-Use Automation System
**interface.ai — Engineering Team**

**Format:** Design + working implementation + short write-up. Public GitHub repo.

**Time box:** No deadline. We expect a focused effort, not a polished product — see Section 5.

**What we're evaluating:** How you design and implement a computer-use system under realistic
constraints. We care more about clear thinking, sound trade-offs, and a working core than about
breadth of features.

New to some of the terminology? There's a short glossary at the end. The difficulty here is in the
decisions, not the vocabulary.

## 1. Context
Our company builds AI agents for banks and credit unions. This project is about the backend
integration layer that gives those agents hands — the system that lets an AI agent actually
operate an institution's back-office applications to get real work done.

When a system exposes an API, we integrate through the API — that's always the preferred
path and is out of scope here. The hard reality at banks and credit unions is the long tail of
legacy applications that have no API at all: core banking screens, servicing tools, and admin
consoles where the only way in is to drive the UI the way a human operator would. This system
exists for that case. It uses an LLM ("computer use") to figure out how to accomplish a task the
first time, then turns what it learned into deterministic, replayable automation that no longer
needs the model in the loop. Each such recording becomes a reusable, reviewable,
parameterized capability that the AI agents can invoke on demand — reliably and cheaply —
without re-reasoning about the UI every time.

Framed differently: the agent-facing product decides what to do; this system is how it reliably
and safely does it inside legacy bank software that offers no other way in.

### The real environment
The applications we automate are back-office business systems used by US banks and
credit unions — the internal apps their staff use to service accounts, process transactions, and
administer the institution. Three properties of this environment shape everything:

- Stable UIs, but real runtime errors. These are enterprise business apps, not
   fast-moving consumer sites: the UI for a given app is fairly consistent and changes
   slowly, which is exactly what makes a record-once / replay-many model viable. The
   hard part is not constant drift — it's that a replay must accommodate the errors and
   exceptional states that legitimately occur at runtime: validation errors, "record not
   found," permission denials, unexpected confirmation dialogs, session/timeout expiry,
   transient slowness, and outright app errors. A capability that only works on the happy
   path is not useful in production.
- Heterogeneous, often legacy surfaces. A given app might be a modern web app, a
   legacy web app (server-rendered, framesets, deeply nested tables, non-semantic
   markup, no test IDs), or a native desktop application. You cannot assume a clean
   DOM, stable selectors, or an API. In many cases the only reliable surface is what a
   human operator sees and does.
- Multi-tenant at scale. There are hundreds of tenants (institutions), each running
   ~20 apps — thousands of app instances overall. Critically, many tenants run the same
   underlying vendor product configured, branded, and versioned differently. Automation
   that works for one tenant should ideally generalize — or degrade gracefully — across
   the others rather than being rebuilt from scratch each time.

This project asks you to build a small but real version of that idea end to end, designed with
those realities in mind even though you'll only implement against one concrete surface.

Note: This is intentionally under-specified. Part of what we're assessing is the judgment you
apply when a problem is open-ended. Where the brief doesn't dictate an answer, make a
decision, and tell us why.

## 2. The problem
Build a system that can:

1. Take a goal in natural language for a target application (e.g. "look up member 12345
and read their current savings balance", "open a new sub-account for this member and
reach the confirmation screen", or — if you use a public proxy target — "add a specific
item to the cart and reach the checkout review page").

2. Use an LLM to accomplish that goal by driving a real application surface — observing
the current state, deciding what to do, and acting. The surface may be a browser, but
treat that as one case of a more general "computer use" problem (accessibility tree,
screenshot + coordinates, OS-level automation, etc. are all fair game).
3. Record the successful run as a structured, reusable artifact — a typed, versioned
description of the flow (the steps taken, how each target element/control is identified,
and any data to extract) that is decoupled from the raw model transcript.
4. Replay that artifact deterministically — re-run the recorded flow without the LLM in
the decision loop, using stable element/control targeting, and report success/failure.
5. Escalate to a human when stuck — when the system can't safely proceed, route an
intervention request to a human operator and let them take control of the live session,
then hand control back.
6. Stay within safety guardrails throughout — respect an allowlist of what the agent is
permitted to do, and avoid leaking or persisting sensitive data (this is regulated financial
data).

The through-line to keep in mind:

The model discovers. The artifact becomes a reusable capability. Deterministic replay is
how the AI agent invokes it in production.

## 3. Core requirements (must-have)
These are the requirements we will evaluate against. How you satisfy them is up to you.

### 3.1 Goal-driven agent loop
- Accept a goal + a target (app/URL/entry point) as input.
- Run an LLM-driven observe → decide → act loop against a live surface until the goal is
   met or a stopping condition is hit (max steps, timeout, dead-end).
- The agent must actually interact with a real UI (click, type, navigate, read state). You
   choose the mechanism (DOM-level automation, accessibility tree, screenshot +
   coordinates, OS-level automation, etc.). Bias toward an approach that would still work
   when the surface has no clean DOM — that's the common case in our environment.

### 3.2 Structured artifact (an agent-invocable capability)
After a successful run, emit a typed, serializable artifact that captures the reusable flow. Think
of it as a capability an AI agent can call — so it needs a clear contract, not just a step list. At
minimum it should express:

- the ordered steps / actions,
- how each target element/control is identified (with your reasoning about robustness),
- typed input parameters (the inputs the agent supplies per invocation, e.g. a member
   ID),
- typed outputs / data to extract and their shape (what the agent gets back),
- a checkpoint or success condition.

The artifact should be versioned and reviewable — both a human reviewer and a calling agent
should be able to understand what the capability does, what it needs, and what it returns.
Design the schema deliberately; it's a focal point of the evaluation.

### 3.3 Deterministic replay (the production execution path)
- Given a saved artifact and a set of input parameters, replay it without invoking the
   LLM for decisions. This is the path an AI agent would trigger in production.
- Replay must use stable element/control targeting, verify the checkpoint/success
   condition, and return any declared outputs to the caller.
- Handle errors and exceptional states explicitly. Because the UI is stable, the
   interesting failures aren't layout drift — they're runtime conditions: a validation error, a
   "record not found" result, a permission denial, an unexpected dialog, a session timeout,
   or a slow/failed load. Your replay should detect these and respond deliberately rather
   than blindly proceeding. Distinguish, in your result contract, between:
    - expected business outcomes the caller needs to know about (e.g. "no such
   member" is a legitimate result, not a crash),
    - recoverable conditions (e.g. dismiss a known interstitial, wait/retry a transient
   load), and
    - hard failures that should stop and surface a clear, debuggable error.
- Report a clear, structured result: success (with outputs), a known business outcome, or a
   failure with enough detail to debug (what step, what was expected, what was observed).

### 3.4 Safety & policy guardrails
- Enforce an explicit, configurable allowlist (e.g. permitted domains/routes, and which
   action types are allowed). The agent must not act outside it.
- Distinguish "safe/reversible" actions from risky/irreversible ones, and handle the risky
   class conservatively (block, require confirmation, or flag — your call, justify it).
- Never persist secrets or raw sensitive data (credentials, tokens, full PII) into artifacts
   or logs. Redact appropriately.

### 3.5 Evidence / observability
Produce enough evidence to understand and debug a run: a structured log of what the agent
did and why, and at least one richer signal on failure (screenshot, DOM snapshot, trace, etc. —
your choice).

### 3.6 Human-in-the-loop escalation & handoff
Sometimes the system can't safely finish on its own — the agent is stuck during discovery, a
replay hits a condition it can't recover from, or a risky/irreversible step needs a person to decide.
In those cases the system must be able to bring a human into the loop:

- Detect and route. Identify a stuck/blocked state and raise an intervention request to a
   human operator, carrying enough context to act on it (which capability/goal, the current
   step, the current state or screenshot, and why it stopped).
- Take control of the live session. Let the human operate the same live session the
   automation was using — not a fresh one — perform the manual steps, and then hand
   control back so the run can resume or complete. Preserve context and evidence across
   the handoff, and record what the human did.
- Think about the seam this implies: automation must be able to pause, cede control,
   and resume on the same session, and there must be a way to know who is (or should
   be) in control.

Scope note: A full real-time co-browsing operator console is out of scope. A minimal but real
handoff — pause automation, expose the live session for manual control (even a bare/mock
operator surface), signal resume, and capture the human's actions — plus a clear design for the
rest, is what we're after. Mock the operator UI if needed, but make the handoff mechanism
and the control-transfer model real and well-reasoned.

### 3.7 Design for heterogeneity & scale (design, not necessarily build)
You will implement against one concrete surface, but your design should have a credible
answer to the environment described in Section 1. In your write-up, address:

- Surface abstraction: how your artifact schema and replay engine would extend from
   your chosen surface (e.g. a web app) to a legacy web app and/or a desktop app. What's
   the seam between "how we perceive/act on a surface" and "the recorded flow"?
- Multi-tenant reuse: hundreds of tenants run ~20 apps each, and many share the same
   underlying vendor product. How would you represent an artifact so it can be reused (or
   safely specialized/overridden) across tenants running the same app, rather than
   re-recorded per tenant? How do you detect and manage per-tenant/version drift?

We don't expect you to implement multi-tenant or desktop support. We do expect the core
abstractions not to paint you into a corner.

## 4. Explicitly your call
We are not prescribing any of the following. Choose what you think is best and defend it in your
write-up:

- Language, runtime, and frameworks.
- LLM provider / model, and how you prompt and structure the agent loop.
- Computer-use technology (Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium, a CUA/agent SDK,
   screenshot-based control, accessibility APIs, OS automation frameworks, etc.).
- Target application (a stand-in for the real thing). We are not giving you access to a
   real bank system, and you should not try to obtain one. Pick a proxy target that lets you
   exercise the interesting problems: a non-trivial multi-step flow (search → detail → action,
   or a multi-field form with a confirmation step). Good options include a public
   demo/sandbox site, a local sample app you build or mock, or — if you want to lean into
   the "legacy/no-clean-DOM" reality — an intentionally hostile surface (iframes/framesets,
   table-based layouts, no test IDs) or even a simple desktop app. If you use a public site,
   respect its terms and rate limits, and never use real credentials or real PII.
- The artifact schema and how it's stored/serialized.
- How determinism is achieved on replay (locator strategy, fallbacks, waiting, etc.).
- Architecture and boundaries (single process vs. services, sync vs. queued, etc.).
   Simpler is fine if justified.

One thing that isn't your call: the discovery run has to be real. At least one genuine
LLM-driven run against a live surface, with the evidence in `/evidence/` to show it happened.
That's the heart of the project and we can't assess a description of it. You'll need your own
model API access; a single successful run is not an expensive thing to produce.

Everywhere else, a clean seam is fine. The operator console, a desktop surface, anything
Section 3 already lets you stub — mock it deliberately and document what you mocked and
why. We'd rather see a well-designed seam than a stalled project.

## 5. Scope & expectations
We assume AI-assisted development. Use Cursor, Claude, Copilot, or whatever you normally
reach for — we expect it and encourage it. That assumption sets the bar: with modern tooling,
the scaffolding-heavy parts (agent loop, schemas, replay executor, guardrails, logging) come
together fast, so what we're looking for is a complete end-to-end vertical slice that touches
every core requirement in Section 3 — not just one or two of them.

Concretely, we're looking for a working thread that runs all the way through:

a goal → an LLM-driven run that completes it → a saved capability artifact → a deterministic
replay with input params, outputs, and error/outcome handling → a human-escalation path
that can take over the live session → evidence for both runs.

Because implementation throughput is no longer the bottleneck, the real test is judgment and
integration: the quality of your artifact schema, your locator/control-robustness strategy, your
error taxonomy, your control-transfer model, and how coherently the pieces fit together. That's
where we'll focus, and you should be ready to defend every decision.

Depth is where you exercise judgment, not breadth:

- Go deep where it matters — the artifact schema, deterministic replay plus error
   handling, and the safety/escalation model are the load-bearing pieces.
- Cut depth, not whole capabilities. Prefer a thin-but-real version of every core
   requirement over a polished subset. It's fine to keep something minimal, stubbed at a
   clean seam, or mocked (the operator UI, the desktop surface) — as long as it's
   intentional, documented, and the seam and design are real.
- Say what you cut and why, and what you'd build next with more time.

## 6. Deliverables
Please use these exact paths and headings — we read a lot of submissions side by side.

1. Source code in a public git repository, with `/README.md` covering:

   - how to set up and run it (include any keys/config needed, and how to run without live
   services if applicable),
   - a demo path: the exact command(s) to run the agent on a goal, then replay the resulting
     artifact.

2. A design write-up at `/REPORT.md` (~1–3 pages), using these seven headings:

   1. Architecture — your architecture and the key decisions plus trade-offs.
   2. Artifact schema — the schema and why you shaped it that way.
   3. Determinism & error handling — how you make replay deterministic, and how you
      detect and handle runtime errors and exceptional states (and, secondarily, any UI drift).

   4. Heterogeneity & multi-tenant — how your design extends to legacy web and desktop
      surfaces, and to reuse across institutions running the same app (see 3.7).
   5. Escalation & handoff — how you detect "stuck," how a human takes control of the live
      session, and how control is handed back.
   6. Safety — your guardrail model and its limits.
   7. Cuts — what you deliberately left out, and what you'd build next.

3. A demonstration of the end-to-end flow in `/evidence/` — a saved example artifact plus
logs from both a discovery run and a replay run. Ideally include one replay that hits an error or
exceptional state (a bad input, a not-found result, or an injected/simulated failure) to show how
your system detects and reports it. A short screen recording is welcome but optional.

## 7. Evaluation criteria
We'll weigh these roughly in this order.

System design. Clear boundaries, sensible data models, good trade-offs, appropriate
simplicity. The artifact schema and replay contract are central.

Correctness of the core loop. The agent actually completes a real goal; the artifact replays
deterministically and verifies success.

Robustness & error handling. How your replay detects and responds to runtime errors and
exceptional states; how cleanly it separates expected business outcomes from recoverable
conditions and hard failures; sound locator, wait, and checkpoint strategy.

Human-in-the-loop escalation. A real, well-reasoned mechanism to detect "stuck," route an
intervention request with context, transfer control of the live session to a human, and resume
afterward — not just a TODO.

Generalization to the real environment. A credible design story for heterogeneous surfaces
and for reusing artifacts across many tenants running the same app, without brittle assumptions
or per-tenant rebuilds.

Safety & data handling. Allowlist enforcement, treatment of risky and irreversible actions,
redaction of regulated financial data.

Code quality. Readable, reasonably typed and tested where it counts, easy to run.

Communication. The write-up makes your reasoning, trade-offs, and cut lines clear.

We do not reward feature breadth, framework name-dropping, or building scaling infrastructure
(queues, clusters, multi-tenant plumbing). Designing your core abstractions so they could scale
to the real environment is valuable; prematurely building that infrastructure is not. A small,
correct, well-argued system is the goal.

## 8. Optional stretch goals
Only if you have time and a solid core. Pick at most one or two — depth over breadth.

- Agent-facing capability interface: expose saved artifacts as a catalog of callable
   capabilities (a small tool/function-calling surface, or an API endpoint) that an AI agent
   could discover and invoke by name with typed args — and show one being invoked.
- Code generation: emit a runnable test or automation snippet (a page object, a test file)
   from an artifact.
- Confidence & approval: score artifacts by how reliably they replay, and gate
   unattended replay on an approval state (draft → approved).
- Assisted fallback: on replay failure, allow a bounded, policy-checked LLM recovery for
   a single step (never open-ended), and record it as evidence.
- Canonicalization / cross-tenant reuse: normalize concrete routes and values into
   parameterized patterns (/item/12345 → /item/:id), and/or demonstrate one artifact
   recorded on a "base" app being applied to a second, slightly different variant — a
   stand-in for two tenants running the same vendor product — with per-variant overrides.
- Multi-run stability: replay N times and report a stability/flakiness signal.

## 9. Ground rules
- AI-assisted development is assumed and encouraged. Use whatever coding
   assistants, models, libraries, and tools you normally would. We care about the result, the
   design, and your reasoning — not whether you hand-wrote every line. The flip side: you
   own everything you submit and must be able to explain and defend any part of it in
   detail.
- Don't automate against sites where doing so would violate their terms, harm the service,
   or require real credentials you shouldn't use. Prefer sandboxes, demo sites, or a local
   app for anything sensitive.
- Keep secrets out of the repo.
- Time-box it yourself. There's no deadline, but this is not meant to consume your month
   — we're evaluating judgment, not endurance. If you stop early, document the rest as
   next steps.

## 10. Glossary
Not knowing these is fine. Not looking them up is the problem.

Computer use — an LLM operating a computer interface the way a person would, reading the
screen or page and then clicking and typing, rather than calling an API.

DOM — the browser's structured representation of a page. A "clean DOM" has meaningful
elements and stable identifiers; legacy apps often don't.

Accessibility tree — the parallel representation browsers and operating systems expose for
screen readers. Often more stable than raw markup, and available on desktop apps too.

Locator / selector — how you tell automation which control to act on. The choice determines
whether replay still works next month.

Test ID — an attribute developers add specifically so automation can find an element reliably.
Legacy enterprise apps essentially never have them.

Deterministic replay — re-running a recorded flow the same way every time, with no model
deciding anything. Same inputs, same steps, same outputs.

Checkpoint — a condition you assert to confirm you actually reached the state you expected,
rather than assuming the click worked.

Business outcome vs. failure — "no such member" is a legitimate answer the caller needs,
not a crash. Conflating the two is the most common design mistake here.

Tenant — one customer institution. Hundreds of them, many running the same vendor software
configured differently.
